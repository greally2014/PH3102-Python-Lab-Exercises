# PH3102-Python-Lab-Exercises
Python exercises from my third year labs in Physics Computer Programming PH3102.

## Lab 1: Projectile Simulator
### Description
This program takes two inputs: the launch angle (degrees) and launch velocity (m/s) and calculates how far the projectile will travel before hitting the ground.
The travel trajectory is graphed using pyplot.

### Installation
Download "Projectile Simulator.ipynb" and run it on Jupyter Notebook. Matplotlib is required.

### Usage
Enter the launch angle and launch velocity respectively. The launch velocity must be positive and the launch angle must be between 0 and 90 degrees.


## Lab 2: Young's Double Slit Experiment
### Description
This program simulates the famous double slit experiment conducted by Thomas Young. The experiment highlighted the wave-particle duality of light. Here is a wikipedia artile explaining explaining the experiment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment. The program caluclates and graphs the diffraction pattern of the light propagating through the double slit. The intensity of the diffraction pattern varies with wavelength.

### Installation
Download "Young's Double Slit Simulator.ipynb" and run it on Jupyter Notebook. Numpy and matplotlib are required.

### Usage
Enter a wavelength when prompted. The wavelength must be between 400 and 700 nanotmetres (visible spectrum).


## Lab 3: Star Colour Magnitude Diagram
### Description
This program graphs a colour magnitude diagram using data from a provided text file. A colour magnitude diagram is a distribution graph of the population of stars against their brightness (or luminosity) and colour (or surface temperature).

### Installation
Download "Projectile Simulator.ipynb" and run it on Jupyter Notebook. Matplotlib is requried. If you need my data text file message me using my email.

### Usage
Specify the name of the data file to be imported before running the program.


## Lab 4: Outputting Data to a Tab-Delimited Text File
### Description
This program outputs Voltage vs Time data from a specified electrical signal in the form of a tab-delimited text file.

### Installation
Download "Outputting to a tab-delimited text file.ipynb" and run it on Jupyter Notebook. Numpy and matplotlib are required.

### Usage
Specify the save location of the text file before running the program.


## Lab 5Sine Wave Simulator
### Description
This program graphs a 3D sine wave using matplotlib and numpy.

### Installation
Download "3D Sine Wave Simulator.ipynb" and run it on Jupyter Notebook. Matplotlib, numpy and mpl_toolkits are required.

### Usage
Specify your desired sine function variables before running the program.
