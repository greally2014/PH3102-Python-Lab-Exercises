# PH3102-Python-Lab-Exercises
These are Python exercises from my third year labs in Physics Computer Programming PH3102.

##Lab 1: Projectile Simulator
###Description
This program takes two inputs: the launch angle (degrees) and launch velocity (m/s) and calculates how far the projectile will travel before hitting the ground. It is assumed the ground is perfectly flat and there is no wind resistance.
The program also graphs the projectile path using pyplot.

###Installation
Download the file and run on Jupyter Notebook. The program uses Matplotlib for the graph and its installation is required.

###Usage
Run the file. It will ask for the launch angle and launch velocity respectively. The launch velocity must be positive and the launch angle must be between 0 and 90 degrees.


##Lab 2: Tennis Serve Simulator
###Description
This program takes two inputs: the launch angle of the serve (degrees) and launch velocity (m/s) of the serve and calculates whether or not the tennis serve clears the net at centre-court. The net is located 6.4 metres from the serving mark and is 0.91 metres high at the centre.

###Installation
Download the file and run on Jupyter Notebook.

###Usage
Run the file. It will ask for the launch angle and launch velocity respectively. The launch velocity must be positive and the launch angle must be between 0 and 90 degrees.

##Lab 3: Young's Double Slit Experiment Simulator
###Description
This program simulates the famous double slit experiment conducted by Thomas Young. The experiment highlighted the wave-particle duality of light. Here is a wikipedia artile explaining explaining the experiment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment . The program caluclates and graphs the diffraction of the light propagating through the double slit. The intensity of the pattern varies with wavelength.

###Installation
Download the file and run on Jupyter Notebook. This program using both Numpy and Matplotlib and their installation is required.

###Usage
Run the file and enter a wavelength when prompted. The wavelength must be between 400 and 700 nanotmetres (visible spectrum).

##Lab 4: Gaussian Filter for Image Blurring
###Description
This program computes the fourier transform of two images and applies a blurring effect using a Gaussian filter.

###Installation
Download the file and run on Jupyter Notebook. This program requires the libraries Numbpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Pylab to run.

###Usage
Simply run the program. It only works on the image referenced in the program input: "OneCircle.png". If you need the image please message me and I will provide it for you.

##Lab 5: Star Colour Magnitude Diagram
###Description
This program graphs a colour magnitude diagram using data from a provided text file. A colour magnitude diagram is a distribution graph of the population of stars against their brightness (or luminosity) and colour (or surface temperature).

###Installation
Download and run the file on Jupyter Notebook. This program requires matplotlib to be installed and needs a data file to be imported. If you need the file I used in program, contact me using my email.

###Usage
Run the file, specifying the name of the file to be imported.

##Lab 6: Outputting to a Tab-Delimited Text File
###Description
This program outputs Voltage vs Time data from a specified electrical signal and outputs the data in the form of a tab-delimited text file.

###Installation
Download and run the file on Jupyter Notebook. This program requires numpy and matplotlib to be installed.

###Usage
Run the file after specifying the save location of the output data text file.

##Lab 7: Sine Wave Simulator
###Description
This program graphs a 3D sine wave using matplotlib and numpy.

###Installation
Downlaod and run the file on Jupyter Notebook. This program requires matplotlib, numpy and mpl_toolkits to be installed.

###Usage
Run the file after specifiying variable values in the sine function.
